# MyWeeklyMoods
This application allows you to indicate your mood every day and record it in a history.
You can change your mood several times during the day but at midnight, only the last one will be kept.
At midnight, the screen will reset to the default happy mood.
You can also add a comment to justify your mood of the day.
The history is spread over a week and will display in addition to the color corresponding to the mood chosen the previous day, an icon indicating that you have written a note.
By clicking on this icon you can read your note which will appear as a toast.
If you have not written anything, no icon will appear.
